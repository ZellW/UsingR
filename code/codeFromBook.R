boxplot(Speed ~ Expt, data=michelson)#Model formula example. Speed is broken into groups defined my Expt (Speed in theis case is the y value) p 98 UsingR Book
#It shows how Speed (y) varies across groups (x) defined by Experiment
boxplot(Speed ~ Expt, data=michelson, subset=Expt %in% 3:4)
#subset displays only experiments 3 and 4 in the dataset - filtering example
#y ~ x:  y is the response (dependent) variable; x is the predictor (independent) variable
plot(fat$wrist, fat$neck) #is the ame as
plot(neck ~ wrist, fat)

#Paired Data (Numerical)P 102
cor(fat$wrist, fat$neck) #strongly correlated
cor(fat$wrist, fat$height) #mildly correlated
cor(fat$age, fat$ankle) #uncorrelated

#correlations formed from averages are typically closer to 1 or -1 than when all the data is considered individually  see page 11 of UsingR

cor(SAT$salary, SAT$total)#no correlation - is is Negative
#perc is the percentage of stidents that took the SAT - let's evaluate the effect of this:
plot(total ~ salary, data=SAT)# no correlation evident
points(total ~ salary, SAT, subset = perc<10, pch=15)#squares
points(total ~ salary, SAT, subset = perc>40, pch=16)#solid
#correlation for each subgroup appears positive
cor10 <- SAT %>% filter(perc<10) %>% select(salary, total)
corMiddle <- SAT %>% filter(perc>10, perc<40) %>% select(salary, total)
cor40 <- SAT %>% filter(perc>40) %>% select(salary, total)
c(less=cor(cor10$total, cor10$salary), middle=cor(corMiddle$total, corMiddle$salary), cor(cor40$total, cor40$salary))#returns all positive
#Correlations for all subgroups are positive when overall is negative.  
#Simpson's Paradox (when a trend for subgroups changes when data is aggregated.

#Linear Regression
residual <- lm(maxrate ~ age, data=heartrate)#to determine max heart rate by age, tradition is to 220- age (a line slope -1 intercept 220)
# residuals = observed - expected - sum of all residuals theortically add to 0
plot(maxrate ~ age, heartrate)
abline(residual)
#can use the predict function to calculate results from a lm:
predict(residual, data.frame(age=c(30, 40)))
plot(residual)#pretty cool -s ee all teh plots that are created

#Paired Bivariate Data:  categorical data (P 132)
#Usually involves counts of 2 categories - The distribution of an individual variable is called marginal distribution
#Sometimes you need to build the data - matrix is useful
