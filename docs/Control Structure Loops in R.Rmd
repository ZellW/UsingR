We will learn about control structures loops used in R. Control strcutures in R contains conditionals, loop statements like any other programming languages.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="../figures/control_structures.png"></p>

Loops are very important and forms backbone to any programming languages.

##If else statement:##
```{r}
#See the code syntax below for if else statement 
x=10
if(x>1){
 print("x is greater than 1")
 }else{
  print("x is less than 1")
  } 

#See the code below for nested if else statement

 
  x=10
 if(x>1 & x<7){
     print("x is between 1 and 7")}else if(x>8 & x< 15){
         print("x is between 8 and 15")
     }


```



##For loops:##
As we know for loops are used for iterating items 
```{r}
 #Below code shows for  loop implementation
x = c(1,2,3,4,5)
 for(i in 1:5){
     print(x[i])
 }
```

##While loop:##
```{r}
#Below code shows while loop in R
x = 2.987
while(x <= 4.987) { 
     x = x + 0.987
     print(c(x,x-2,x-1)) 
}
```

##Repeat Loop:##
The repeat loop is an infinite loop and used in association with a break statement.
```{r}
#Below code shows repeat loop:
a = 1
repeat{
     print(a)
     a = a+1 
     if(a > 4)break}
```

##Break statement:##
 A break statement is used in a loop to stop the iterations and flow the control outside of the loop. 
```{r}
 #Below code shows break statement:
x = 1:10 
 for (i in x){ 
     if (i == 2){ 
         break 
     }
     print(i)
 }
```

##Next statement:##
Next statement enables to skip the current iteration of a loop without terminating it. 
```{r}
 #Below code shows next statement 
x = 1: 4 
 for (i in x) { 
     if (i == 2){ 
         next}
     print(i)
 }
```
